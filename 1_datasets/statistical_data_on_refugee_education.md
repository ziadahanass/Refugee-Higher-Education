# 🎓 Notes on Refugee Access to Higher Education

This document gathers key statistics, research insights, and policy data
relevant to our work on how refugee and displaced youth access higher education,
the barriers they face, and the role of scholarships and support programmes.

## 🌍 Global Access & Participation

- Globally, **only a small minority of refugees reach higher education**  
  (around one in every fourteen refugee youth, compared to much higher rates for non-refugee youth).
- UNHCR’s global strategy aims to **increase refugee participation in tertiary education to 15% by 2030**.
- Most refugee learners who do access higher education do so through:
  - public **national universities** in host countries  
  - **scholarship programmes** (e.g., DAFI)  
  - **connected learning** or blended online–offline programmes.
  - Fewer than **10% of refugee youth** globally access higher education.
- By comparison, global tertiary enrolment among non-refugee youth exceeds
  **40%**.
- This represents a **30+ percentage-point gap** in access.
- Global initiatives aim to raise refugee participation to **15% by 2030**.
- Most refugee students who reach higher education do so via:
  - national universities in host countries
  - scholarship-supported pathways
  - blended or connected learning models.

## 🚧 Key Barriers to Higher Education

Across different host countries, the same types of barriers appear again and again:

- **Financial barriers**
  - Tuition fees, registration charges, and cost of living (housing, transport, books).  
  - Refugee households often prioritise immediate income over long study periods.

- **Legal and documentation barriers**
  - No or insecure **residency status**.  
  - Missing **school certificates** or university transcripts from the country of origin.  
  - Complicated or unclear procedures for **recognising prior qualifications**.

- **Language and academic preparation**
  - Host-country universities may teach mainly in **English or French**, while refugees were educated in another language.  
  - Gaps in secondary schooling due to conflict and displacement reduce readiness for university.

- **Information and guidance gaps**
  - Limited access to **career counselling** or clear information on admission routes and scholarships.  
  - Many refugee youth simply do not know what opportunities exist or how to apply.

- **Digital and infrastructure barriers**
  - Weak or expensive internet access limits participation in connected and online learning.  
  - Lack of devices (laptops, tablets) and safe study spaces.

## 🎓 Scholarships & Support Pathways

- **DAFI Tertiary Scholarship Programme**
  - Provides **tuition**, **living stipends**, and **mentoring** for refugee students in host-country universities.  
  - Helps students not only enter higher education but also **persist and graduate**.

- **International scholarship models (IOM study)**
  - Compares:
    - **In-country scholarships** (study in the country of asylum)  
    - **Third-country scholarships** (relocation to another country)  
    - **Online / blended** models.
  - Highlights good practices such as:
    - clear selection criteria  
    - holistic support (living costs, language courses, psychosocial support)  
    - strong partnerships with universities and NGOs.

- Common design lessons:
  - Scholarships work best when combined with **language support**, **academic bridging**, and **career guidance**.  
  - Small, competitive schemes help individuals but do not yet meet the **scale of global need**.

## 🇱🇧 Case Study: Syrian Refugee Youth in Lebanon

Research from the American University of Beirut (AUB) shows how global issues
play out in a specific national context:

**🇱🇧 Case Overview: Syrian Refugee Youth in Lebanon – Access to Higher Education**

| Aspect                          | Summary (Based on AUB / IFI Lebanon Studies)                                                                 |
|---------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Overall Access                  | Only a small fraction of Syrian refugee youth are enrolled in Lebanese universities compared to their age group. Most who finish secondary school still do **not** reach higher education. |
| Financial Barriers              | High tuition fees, registration costs, transport, books, and living expenses make university largely unaffordable without scholarships or external support. |
| Legal & Documentation Barriers  | Many students lack valid residency, original certificates, or official transcripts from Syria. Complex and unclear **equivalence** procedures block or delay admissions. |
| Language & Academic Preparedness| Lebanese higher education is often taught in **English or French**, while many Syrian students were educated mainly in Arabic, creating gaps in academic readiness. |
| Information & Guidance          | Refugee students frequently have limited access to **career guidance**, admissions advice, or clear information about available scholarships and support programmes. |
| Existing Supports               | A mix of local and international actors (universities, NGOs, donors, and schemes like DAFI) provide scholarships, language support, and some preparatory programmes. |
| Remaining Gaps                  | Support is fragmented and small in scale. Many eligible students are not reached, and structural issues (residency, recognition of qualifications, long-term funding) remain unresolved. |
