# Datasets

This folder contains data sources and reference materials used in the project
**ELO2_RefugeeEdu_AI**, which focuses on using data science and AI-assisted
approaches to improve access to higher education opportunities for refugee and
displaced youth.
Rather than treating data only as evidence of barriers, the materials in this
folder support opportunity discovery, pathway mapping, and information
structuring related to refugee higher education.

**AI, Data Science, and NLP Approach**

After identifying key barriers and education pathways, the project moves toward
structuring fragmented information about scholarships and programmes. Many of
these opportunities exist as unstructured text (web pages, PDFs, reports).
Using data science and **Natural Language Processing (NLP)**, the project
explores how this information can be transformed into structured attributes
(e.g., eligibility, language requirements, funding coverage), enabling clearer
comparison and AI-assisted matching between refugee learner profiles and
available opportunities. AI is used as a **support tool**, not an automated 
decision-maker, to reduce
information gaps and improve visibility of higher-education pathways.



The folder is organized into three main documentation files.

---

## articles.md

This file contains selected academic articles and research papers related to
refugee access to higher education and the role of technology in improving
educational opportunities. These sources provide background, context, and
theoretical insights that complement the project’s data-driven and AI-assisted
analysis.

## RAWDATA.md

This file documents the raw data and reference sources used in the project.
It includes links, short descriptions, and source details for materials related
to:

- refugee participation in education
- higher education access barriers
- documentation and qualification recognition
- scholarship programs and funding mechanisms
- country- and context-specific data (including Lebanon)

The subfolder `rawdata_files/` contains the original source documents used in the
research. All files are kept in their **original, unmodified form** to ensure
transparency and traceability, in line with repository and research guidelines.

## statistical_data_on_refugee_education.md

This document focuses on quantitative indicators and structured statistics
related to refugee education and scholarship pathways. It reviews data from
global initiatives and programs, including:

- enrolment and progression indicators
- scholarship and funding models
- design insights from programs such as the DAFI Scholarship Programme
- feasibility and impact studies from international organizations

The information in this file supports exploratory analysis and helps identify
patterns and opportunities that can be used in AI-assisted matching and pathway
design.

All files in this folder are intended to support the **data and reference
foundation** of the project. They are organized to promote clarity,
reproducibility, and responsible use of data in research and AI-assisted
analysis.
