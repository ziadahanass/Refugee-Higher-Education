# 2_data_analysis

This folder documents the analytical perspective of the project
**ELO2_RefugeeEduAccess**, with a focus on how data science and AI-assisted
methods could help reduce information gaps in access to higher education for
refugee and displaced youth.

Rather than performing large-scale modelling, this stage outlines how
fragmented scholarship and programme information can be structured and
prepared for opportunity discovery.

## 🤖 Role of Data Science and NLP

Many higher-education opportunities are described in **unstructured text**
(web pages, PDFs, reports), which makes comparison and navigation difficult.

This project introduces the idea of using **Natural Language Processing (NLP)**
to:
- extract key attributes from textual descriptions (e.g., eligibility, funding,
  deadlines, language requirements)
- organize this information into structured form
- support clearer visibility of available pathways

The aim is to demonstrate how lightweight NLP and data analysis can improve
access to information, rather than to build a full automated system.

## 📊 Analytical Observations

Based on the reviewed datasets and domain material, several consistent patterns
emerge:

- Access to higher education among refugee youth remains **below 10% globally**,
  compared to more than **40%** among non-refugee youth.
- Scholarship and support programmes are **highly fragmented**, with eligibility
  rules, deadlines, and coverage varying widely across providers.
- A significant share of opportunities are **poorly documented or difficult to
  discover**, especially for students lacking guidance or digital access.
- Funding and support are concentrated among a **small number of major actors**,
  while many smaller programmes remain scattered and hard to navigate.

These observations motivate the use of data structuring and NLP techniques to
reduce information friction and improve opportunity discovery.
