# Access to Higher Education for Refugee Youth in Lebanon

## Project Overview

This project explores how refugee and displaced youth in Lebanon access higher education.  
We focus on the main barriers they face (financial, legal, language, digital) and the programs or initiatives that help them enter or continue university studies.  
Using reports, a small dataset, and a few qualitative responses, we aim to identify key challenges and practical opportunities for improving access.

## Research Questions

1. What are the main barriers that refugee youth in Lebanon face when trying to access higher education?
2. What types of programs or supports (scholarships, NGOs, online initiatives, mentoring) currently help them access or stay in higher education?
3. Where do learners and practitioners see the biggest gaps in support?
