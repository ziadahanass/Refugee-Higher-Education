# Research Project: Access to Higher Education for Refugee Youth

## 1. Research Focus

**Main question:**  
How do refugee youth around the world access higher education, and what are the main barriers and support programs that shape their chances?

This project will map the key obstacles (money, documents, language, etc.) and the main support pathways (scholarships, NGOs, online learning) that help refugee youth continue their studies after secondary school.

## 2. Key Concepts 

- **Refugee youth** – young people (about 15–29) who have been forced to leave their country and are living in a host country or in displacement.
- **Higher education** – universities, colleges, technical institutes, and other post-secondary programs.
- **Barriers** – financial cost, legal status, missing documents, language of instruction, interrupted schooling, digital access.
- **Support programs** – scholarships, NGO and UN programs, connected/online learning, mentoring, psychosocial support.

## 3. Background & Reference Materials


- [**UNHCR – Refugee Education Report**](https://www.unhcr.org/media/unhcr-education-report-2025)  
   - Global overview of refugee education from primary to tertiary levels.  
   - Includes updated data on how many refugee youth reach higher education and progress toward the 15% by 2030 target.

- [**DAFI – UNHCR Tertiary Scholarship Programme for Refugees** ](https://www.unhcr.org/what-we-do/build-better-futures/education/higher-education-and-skills/dafi-tertiary-scholarship-0)  
   - One of the main global scholarship schemes that funds refugee students in undergraduate programmes.  
   - Covers tuition and related costs and is a key example of a “support pathway” into higher education.

- [**MIT Refugee Action Hub (ReACT)**](https://react.mit.edu/)  
   - MIT initiative that designs connected-learning pathways and certificate programmes for refugees and displaced learners.  
   - Example of an NGO/university-led program that uses online and blended learning to expand access to higher education and skills.

- [**Jusoor Scholarship Program**](https://www.jusoor.ngo/scholarship-program)  
   -  NGO that provides scholarships for Syrian and Palestinian-Syrian youth to study at universities around the world, helping them complete degrees and become future leaders.

-  [**Refugee Academic Futures Scholarships**](https://www.displacedstudent.org.uk/opportunities/refugee-academic-futures-scholarships-2/)  
   -  Scholarships at the University of Oxford that fund graduate study for students who are refugees or have lived experience of displacement, covering fees and living costs.

## 4. Technical Approach
Our approach is focused on combining desk research with a small, simple dataset. We will:

- Map the main barriers and support programs for refugee youth using a few core sources (UNHCR, DAFI, MIT ReACT).
- Build a small illustrative dataset (e.g., region, main barrier, type of support, short note on impact) from public information or a tiny survey.
- Use basic descriptive analysis (simple counts and one or two charts) to show which barriers and supports appear most often.
- Reflect on what these patterns mean for refugee access to higher education and where important gaps remain.
