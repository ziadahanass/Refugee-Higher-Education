# Research Project: Access to Higher Education for Refugee Youth

## 1. Research Focus

Refugee and displaced youth face significant challenges in accessing higher
education, not only due to financial, legal, and language barriers, but also
because information about scholarships and support programs is often fragmented
and difficult to navigate. This project focuses on how data science and
AI-assisted approaches can help organize existing information and highlight
practical opportunities that support refugee access to higher education.

The study focuses on:
- Identifying key information gaps that limit access to higher education
- Understanding common barriers such as funding, documentation, and language
- Mapping existing scholarships, NGO programs, and online learning pathways
- Exploring how AI-assisted tools could connect refugee learners with suitable
  higher education opportunities


## 2. Key Concepts 

- **Refugee youth** – young people (about 15–29) who have been forced to
 leave their country and are living in a host country or in displacement.
- **Higher education** – universities, colleges, technical institutes, 
and other post-secondary programs.
- **Barriers** – financial cost, legal status, missing documents, language
 of instruction, interrupted schooling, digital access.
- **Support programs** – scholarships, NGO and UN programs, connected/online
 learning, mentoring, psychosocial support.

## 4. Technical Approach
Our approach is focused on combining desk research with a 
small, simple dataset. We will:

- Map the main barriers and support programs for refugee youth 
using a few core sources (UNHCR, DAFI, MIT ReACT).
- Build a small illustrative dataset (e.g., region, main barrier, 
type of support, short note on impact) from public information or a tiny survey.
- Use basic descriptive analysis (simple counts and one or two charts)
 to show which barriers and supports appear most often.
- Reflect on what these patterns mean for refugee access to higher 
education and where important gaps remain.


## 5. FRESCO Evaluation

| FRESCO Criterion | Description |
|------------------|-------------|
| **Feasible** | Uses publicly available education and scholarship data, along with established data science and AI techniques |
