# Research Project: Access to Higher Education for Refugee Youth

## 1. Research Focus

**Main question:**  
How do refugee youth around the world access higher education, and what are the main barriers and support programs that shape their chances?

This project will map the key obstacles (money, documents, language, etc.) and the main support pathways (scholarships, NGOs, online learning) that help refugee youth continue their studies after secondary school.

## 2. Key Concepts 

- **Refugee youth** – young people (about 15–29) who have been forced to leave their country and are living in a host country or in displacement.
- **Higher education** – universities, colleges, technical institutes, and other post-secondary programs.
- **Barriers** – financial cost, legal status, missing documents, language of instruction, interrupted schooling, digital access.
- **Support programs** – scholarships, NGO and UN programs, connected/online learning, mentoring, psychosocial support.

## 4. Technical Approach
Our approach is focused on combining desk research with a small, simple dataset. We will:

- Map the main barriers and support programs for refugee youth using a few core sources (UNHCR, DAFI, MIT ReACT).
- Build a small illustrative dataset (e.g., region, main barrier, type of support, short note on impact) from public information or a tiny survey.
- Use basic descriptive analysis (simple counts and one or two charts) to show which barriers and supports appear most often.
- Reflect on what these patterns mean for refugee access to higher education and where important gaps remain.
